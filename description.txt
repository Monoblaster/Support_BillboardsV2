this support script requires the selective ghosting dll to be installed on wherever it is running
dll help repository: https://gitlab.com/Queuenard/blockland-DLL

this script allows you to easily create 2d billboards and 2d billboards that are always visible.
a billboard is something that is always facing the players camera.

billboards in this script use light flares to make this effect which is why we have to use light datablocks.
they also use player datablocks which the light flares are attached to.
the player datablocks that this script comes with have no mesh and just contain mount points.
if you want to make your own model for light mounting it is very simple:
make a model with 2 mount points.
make sure the second mount point is where you want your billboard to appear.
and that's it!


Mount Functions:
Mount datablock refers to a PlayerData that inherits from DefaultBillboardMount.
Mount refers to an AiPlayer created by it's mount datablock's Make function.
Billboard datablock refers to a FxLightData that inherits from DefaultBillboard.
Billboard refers to a FxLight created by BillboardMount_AddBillboard.

A AVBillboard datablock refers to a FxLightData that inherits from DefaultAVBillboard.

AvBillboards can be seen through solid objects but require special setup for them to work properly.

AVBillboardGroup_Make()
Creates a AVBillboardGroup.
return      :   A new AVBillboardGroup.

(AVBillboardGroup).Load(%client,%num)
This function is required for the AVBillboardGroup to function.
It may only be ever used on a single client per AVBillboardGroup.
This function creates a camera for the client at $AVBillboard::loadTransform and spawns the soon to be AVBillboards infront of them.
The camera's datablock is BillboardLoadingCamera so you may use that if you want player input call FinishLoad.
%client     :   A client.
%num        :   The number of AVBillboards to make.
return      :   The AVBillboardGroup.

(AVBillboardGroup).FinishLoad()
This function is also required for the AVBillboardGroup to function.
This function must be called sometime after the Load function.
This function resets the players camera and finalizes the process of making AVBillboards.
Since this process is client sided you must make sure to give the client time before calling this function.
return      :   The AVBillboardGroup.

(AVBillboardGroup).Clear(%tag)
Clears all AVBillboards from being visible.
%tag        :   An optional field when specified only clears billboards with the specified tag.
